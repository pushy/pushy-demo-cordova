# pushy-demo-cordova

A demo of the [Pushy SDK for Cordova](https://github.com/pushy/pushy-cordova) integrated into a sample Cordova app.

> [Pushy](https://pushy.me/) is the most reliable push notification gateway, perfect for real-time, mission-critical applications.

This app registers your device to receive push notifications and assigns it a unique token, which you can copy and paste into the [demo page](https://pushy.me/docs/resources/demo) to send yourself a test push notification on both Android and iOS.

Visit our documentation to [integrate Pushy into your existing Cordova app](https://pushy.me/docs/additional-platforms/cordova).
